                     <p>
                         Over the winter break from classes, I wanted to make sure
                         that my newly-learned Python skills didn't begin to fade.
                         I started looking for a project that I could work
                         on, outside of testing my abilities with code snippets on the
                         <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>
                        website. While HackerRank was definitly keeping my skills honed, I
                        really wanted something with more substance, cohesion and complexity;
                        I needed to see if I could code something complete, from the ground up...
                        a useful, functional programming project that I could work on, and yet
                        still complete within the given timeframe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To better understand the core functionality of Python, it needed
                        to be something that could be created using the basic, out-of-the-box
                        install of the Python language (or as close to it as possible),
                        without a lot of added plugins or external modules to cut corners.
                        I wanted to use my new skills to create something complex, but not
                        necesarily dive straight into the deep water too fast, and start drowning.
                        I was looking for a project or subject matter that was familiar and
                        that I knew well; something that would alow me to focus on learning
                        the language, not also learning about the subject matter of <em>what</em>
                        the code was doing... and that's when I saw a Yahtzee box
                        sitting on the counter.

                         I took out the game and played through several rounds,
                         taking notes on basic strategy, gameplay, turn formats, and
                         any other information I felt would be pertinent to converting
                         the physical game into a computerized version. I also did
                         some research online regarding the game's history and various
                         different versions over the years, as well as researching
                         the most recent rules for playing the game (which, I learned,
                         are quite different from the original rules I grew up playing).

                     <p>
                         Once I had all the notes gathered, I began outlining the
                         structure of how the program would function. I applied the same
                         cyclical technique that I use for art, design and writing (as well
                         as coding in BASIC, AppleScript, HTML, et al) that I often refer
                         to as &ldquo;going Bob Ross&rdquo;; start as simple as possible, and then build,
                         enhance and elaborate, cycling over the project again and again,
                         continuing to make it better with each iteration.

                     <p>
                         Starting with the existing scoring structure, I created a
                         basic one-roll game for one player; they were allowed
                         one roll of all five dice, which would return a score
                         for whatever might be available for the given dice.
                         Once that was in place and functioning properly, I then
                         extended the option to allow for multiple rolls of all
                         of the dice. After that came the addition for re-rolling
                         only certain player-selected dice out of each roll, on the first
                         and second throws, like the actual game. With success in creating
                         that functionality also came the the task of adding the
                         (somewhat complicated) &ldquo;Joker Rules&rdquo; to the game,
                         which only come into play if multiple Yahtzee's are rolled during
                         a game, or if a zero score is taken in the Yahtzee slot, and then
                         a Yahtzee is rolled by that player.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         With that core functionality in place, the entire game could be played,
                         by one person -- from beginning to end -- while completely following
                         the current Yahtzee rules and scoring system. I was then able able to
                         easily replicate the process, extending the existing gameplay to
                         four possible players at a time, and allowed each player to enter
                         their name (as opposed to just being given the generic &ldquo;Player 1&rdquo;,
                         &ldquo;Player 2&rdquo; monikers).

                     <p>
                         Once the gameplay was tested and bugs were removed, I
                         realized that I really wanted to improve the interface.
                         Initially, I felt somewhat hamstrung by the limitations
                         of the Terminal, and the lack of graphical capabilities
                         in a text-based format. However, I quickly realized that --
                         by using ASCII symbols and some storytelling -- I could
                         create a fun and enjoyable player experience, with some
                         minimalist visuals thrown in.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         After earching through the available ASCII characters and
                         possible text formatting, I went through the game once
                         more, step by step, to see where the experience could be
                         enhanced. I created a splashscreen for the game, a storyline
                         that included some randomized content from the narrator
                         and the dealer, a scorecard that resembled the classic
                         original 1950's Yahtzee scorecard, and vastly improved the
                         display of the dice (which involved some serious planning
                         and forethought, as to how large multi-line dice could be
                         displayed side-by-side in a line-by-line, top-to-bottom
                         text-based format). The end result was a pleasing and
                         engaging experience and a vast improvement to the
                         overall gameplay.

                     <p>
                         When I decided to incorporate a computer opponent, I don't think
                         I truly appreciated how difficult an undertaking that would be,
                         even in a game with straightforward rules such as Yahtzee. The
                         initial version of the computer opponent would select a random
                         available score slot on one of the three rolls (also chosen at random)...
                         however, after watching the computer pass up high rolls several times, due to
                         the utter randomness of the selection setup, I realized that this
                         was a less-than-desirable solution.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         After doing some research, I found two separate dissertations written by
                         computer scientists Tom Berhoeff and James Glenn, which detailed
                         something referred to as the &ldquo;Greed Strategy&rdquo;. This particular
                         strategy allows a player to ascertain -- using a combination of probability
                         and availability -- the best possible option for any given roll
                         during a game. Using a portion of their information as a guide
                         (regarding scoring liklihood and odds), I incorporated a system of looped checks
                         that the robot uses, on every roll, to keep track of the availability
                         of scoring options and the given dice, to select the best option between
                         re-rolling or scoring on any roll. While not perfect, the computer can now
                         best me ~60% of games played, which is significantly better than a player
                         of average skill.

                         While the &ldquo;robot&rdquo; plays well enough at this point,
                         it can be greatly improved. Even though Yahtzee is a game
                         based in both chance and skill, the computer's ability to
                         leverage the skill factor will be increased by several magnitudes.
                         For the next version, I will completely overhaul the current
                         decision processes that the computer uses, so that it's choices
                         will be based on both actual probability <em>and</em> availability,
                         per roll, instead of just the Greed strategy and slot/scoring
                         availability. This upgrade should increase the robot's ability
                         to play smarter, make better scoring and roll decisions, and to
                         win at least 70% of the time it plays, if not more.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         Naturally, there will also need to be levels of ability incorporated
                         into the process (such as &ldquo;Easy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;,
                         and &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;) -- no one will want to play if the computer
                         in unbeatable, and bests them every single time. With an opponent
                         skill choice factored in, human players of various skill levels can
                         have an opponent that best matches thier own skill, providing an
                         enjoyable experience for all.

                     <p>
                         The Pyahtzee project has been a great learning experience
                         so far. It has allowed me to dive into Python, head-first,
                         and push myself and my knowledge. I've experimented with
                         many new things while working on this project, and have
                         worked with code in a way I haven't been able to in a long time.
                         I'm looking forward to continuing my work on the project,
                         and to continue making Pyahtzee a better game with each version.

                     <p>
                         The one and only drawback, however, is a not-so-small issue
                         I realized about half-way into the project; I can't share
                         this project with anyone, outside of screen shots. While
                         the game might be fully functional, looks great for a text-based
                         Terminal game and it plays well, Yahtzee is a copyrighted
                         entity, owned by the Hasbro Company. I will never be able
                         to release it, share my code, have others play the finished
                         game, or really even show it to anyone outside of these
                         educational-based screen shots. This was only created as
                         a learning tool for myself, and I have no intent or desire
                         to break the law, or to infringe on Hasbro's rights.

                         Maybe my next project should be a Public Domain or an existing Open Source project. =)
