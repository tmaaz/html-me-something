                         <p>
                             Over the winter break from classes, I wanted to make sure
                             that my newly-learned Python skills didn't begin to fade.
                             I started looking for a project that I could work on,
                             outside of testing my abilities with code snippets on the
                             <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>
                            website. While HackerRank was definitely keeping my skills honed,
                            I wanted something with more cohesion and complexity. I
                            needed to see if I could code something complete, from the ground
                            up -- a useful coding project that I could work on, that
                            could be complete &amp; functional within the given timeframe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To better understand the core functionality of Python, I only wanted to
                            use an out-of-the-box install of Python (or as close to it as possible),
                            without a lot of added external modules to cut corners. I wanted to use my
                            new skills to create something complex, but not necesarily dive straight
                            into the deep water and immediately start drowning. I was looking for
                            a project or subject matter that was familiar and that I knew well;
                            something that would alow me to focus on learning the language, not also
                            learning about the subject matter of <em>what</em> the code was doing...
                            and that's when I saw my Yahtzee box sitting on the shelf.

                             I unboxed the game and played through several rounds,
                             taking notes on gameplay, basic strategy, and any other
                             information I felt would be pertinent to converting the
                             physical game to a computerized version. I then did
                             some research online regarding the game's history, various
                             different versions over the years, numerous different
                             styles of scorecards, dice, cups and playing boards. I
                             also downloaded the most recent official rules for
                             playing the game (which, I learned, are quite different from
                             the rules I originally grew up playing).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Once I had all the notes gathered, I began outlining the
                             structure of how the program would function. I applied the same
                             cyclical technique that I use for art, design and writing (as well
                             as coding in BASIC, AppleScript, HTML, et al), which I often refer
                             to as &ldquo;going Bob Ross&rdquo;; start as simple as possible, and then build,
                             enhance and elaborate, cycling over the project again and again,
                             continuing to make it better with each iteration.

                         <p>
                             Starting with the existing scoring structure, I created a
                             basic one-roll game for one player; they were allowed
                             one roll of all five dice, which would return a score
                             for whatever might be available for the given dice.
                             Once that was in place and functioning properly, I then
                             extended the option to allow for multiple rolls of all
                             of the dice. After that came the addition for re-rolling
                             selected dice out of each roll, on the first and second
                             throws, like the actual game. With success in creating
                             that functionality also came the the task of adding the
                             &ldquo;Joker Rules&rdquo; to the game, which only come into
                             play if multiple Yahtzee's are rolled during a game, or if
                             a Yahtzee is rolled after a player has already taken a zero
                             score in the Yahtzee slot.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             With that core functionality in place, the entire game could
                             be played, by one person -- from beginning to end -- while
                             completely following the current Yahtzee rules and scoring
                             system. I was then able able to easily replicate the process,
                             extending the existing gameplay to four possible players at a
                             time, and allowed each player to enter thier own name (as
                             opposed to just being given a generic &ldquo;Player 1&rdquo;
                             or &ldquo;Player 2&rdquo; moniker).

                         <p>
                             Once the gameplay was tested and bugs were removed, I
                             realized that I really wanted to improve the interface.
                             Initially, I felt somewhat hamstrung by the limitations
                             of the Terminal, and the lack of graphical capabilities
                             in a text-based format. However, I quickly realized that --
                             by using ASCII symbols and some storytelling -- I could
                             create an enjoyable player experience, with some
                             minimalist visuals thrown in.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             After searching through the available ASCII characters and
                             possible text formatting, I went through the game once
                             more, step by step, to see where the experience could be
                             enhanced. I created a splashscreen, a storyline that
                             included some randomized content from a narrator and
                             dealer characters, a scorecard that resembled the classic
                             original 1950's Yahtzee scorecard, and vastly improved the
                             display of the dice (which ended up being quite involved,
                             as to how large multi-line dice could be displayed side-by-side
                             in a format that's line-by-line and top-to-bottom). The end
                             result was a pleasing and engaging experience, and a major
                             improvement to the overall gameplay.

                             At the onset, I didn't realize how difficult creating a
                             computer opponent would be, even in a game with straightforward
                             rules such as Yahtzee. The initial version of the &ldquo;robot&rdquo;
                             would randomly select a scoring option, on any one of it's rolls
                             (also chosen at random). However, after watching the computer
                             pass up high rolls several times (due to the utter randomness
                             of it's selection), I realized that this was a
                             less-than-desirable solution.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             While doing some research, I found two separate papers written by
                             computer scientists Tom Berhoeff and James Glenn, detailing
                             something called the &ldquo;Greed Strategy&rdquo;. This particular
                             strategy allows a player to ascertain -- using a combination of probability
                             and availability -- the best possible option for any given roll.
                             Using a portion of their information as a guide (regarding scoring
                             odds), I incorporated a system of loops for the robot to keep track
                             of the availability of scoring options and the given dice, to select
                             the best option between re-rolling or scoring on any roll. While not
                             perfect, the computer can now best me ~60% of games played, which is
                             significantly better than a player of average skill.

                             While the &ldquo;robot&rdquo; plays well enough at this point,
                             it can be greatly improved. Even though Yahtzee is a game
                             based in both chance and skill, the computer's ability to
                             leverage the skill factor can be increased by several magnitudes.
                             For the next version, I will completely overhaul the current
                             decision processes that the computer uses, so that it's choices
                             will be based on both actual probability <em>and</em> availability,
                             per roll, instead of just a portion of the Greed Strategy and slot/scoring
                             availability. This upgrade should increase the robot's ability
                             to play smarter, make better scoring and roll decisions, and to
                             win at least 70% of the time it plays, if not more.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             Naturally, there will also need to be levels of ability incorporated
                             into the process (such as &ldquo;Easy&rdquo;, &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;,
                             and &ldquo;Expert&rdquo;) -- no one would want to play if a competitor
                             is unbeatable, and can best them every single time. With an opponent
                             skill choice factored in, human players of various skill levels could
                             have an opponent that best matches thier own skill, providing an
                             enjoyable experience for all.

                             The Pyahtzee project has been a great learning experience
                             so far. It has allowed me to dive into Python, head-first,
                             and push myself and my knowledge. I've experimented with
                             many new things while working on this project, and have
                             worked with code in a way I haven't been able to in a long time.
                             I'm looking forward to continuing my work on the project,
                             and to continue making Pyahtzee a better game with each version.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                             The one drawback, however, is a major issue I realized about
                             half-way into the project; I can't share this project with anyone,
                             outside of screen shots. While the game is fully functional,
                             looks great for a text-based Terminal game and it plays well,
                             Yahtzee is a copyrighted property, owned by the Hasbro Company.
                             I will never be able to release it, share my code, have others
                             play the game, or really even show it to anyone outside of these
                             educational-based screen shots. This was only created as
                             a learning tool for myself, and I have no intent or desire
                             to break the law, or to infringe on Hasbro's rights. So I
                             think my next project will be something original, or
                             one that is in the Public Domain or an Open Source project.
